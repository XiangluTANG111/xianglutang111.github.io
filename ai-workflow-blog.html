                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    I want to summarize how AI helps in my research workflow—what it's good for, what's bad at, and how I keep myself from getting "smoothly misled."
                </p>

                <div class="quote-highlight p-6 rounded-r-lg mb-8">
                    <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-2"><strong>AI is helpful, but it is not a judge.</strong></p>
                    <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-2"><strong>Never trust AI overall.</strong></p>
                    <p class="text-dark-text/80 italic">Use it, argue with it, learn from it—but final judgment is still on you.</p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Why? Because AI often sounds confident even when it's wrong. And it has a very specific failure mode: <strong>it can define things literally</strong>, based on surface words, while in our field the same word might mean something very different. So you always need human grounding.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    With that said—AI is still extremely useful, and I use it across the whole research pipeline.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">1) Come up with ideas: from life observation → construct</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This is where everything starts.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We often have observations from life. We <em>feel</em> something is happening. But we're not sure how to narrow it down into a construct. At that point, I can discuss with GPT. I mainly start from my feelings and intuitions, and then I go read the literature.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Here is the key problem: AI sometimes defines a variable <strong>from the literal meaning</strong>, but the variable itself is not actually that meaning in the field. The concept is not really that.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So the most important thing here is: <strong>humans still have to check the literature.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    But AI is still useful because I can tell it the things that are "hard to articulate," and I can analyze them with it.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    And honestly, the most common scenario for me is:
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    AI says something, and I feel it is definitely wrong—but I can't immediately explain why it's wrong, and it also can't explain itself clearly. Then I start thinking: okay, where exactly is the problem?
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    That moment is powerful. That's when I find the blind spot. I get closer and closer to the real answer.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So yes—sometimes it's literally <strong>my brain fighting with its brain</strong>.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    And that's why <strong>never trust AI overall</strong> is so important.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">2) After I have an idea: measurement → tools → coding / screening</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Once I have an idea, and I know how to measure it, and I've found the tools, the next step is often "coder work":
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    coding, encoding, annotation, screening.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This is one place where AI can scale.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    If you prompt AI to code, it can repeatedly do a lot of items, very fast. But I strongly prefer doing it through an API setup, because I want to reduce "context carryover" across items. I want each case to be independent, not context-aware across the batch.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    It's convenient, but it still needs humans. The biggest issue is still the same:
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>AI is a black box.</strong></p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So I treat AI coding as a tool for throughput, not for truth. Truth still needs validation: samples checked by humans, consistency checks, and clear rules for uncertainty.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">3) Data cleaning and data analysis: AI is a helper, not a replacement</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Later, there's data cleaning and data analysis.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I definitely don't think we can let AI do analysis completely. But when I'm unsure about a method, I <em>do</em> discuss with AI and learn from it. It can explain options, assumptions, and how people usually do things.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mt-8 mb-4">My favorite trick here: "AI duel"</h3>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I call it "AI duel"—two AIs fighting.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    When I really don't understand something, I let GPT answer first, then I ask Gemini or another model to answer the same question. Then I compare.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The point is not "who wins." The point is: <strong>their disagreement shows me where the real uncertainty is.</strong> It helps me narrow the answer space. Then I use more precise wording to find more precise sources, and I go to the actual primary source to confirm.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This is really important because:
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6"><strong>Double check is the most important thing in the whole workflow.</strong></p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    We cannot fully trust AI. It's not "aware." It doesn't have real context. Context is what we provide, and our language is also compressed. So the safest workflow is always: AI helps you narrow → you verify with real sources.
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mt-8 mb-4">Search AI is useful, but still not enough</h3>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Sometimes I also use search-oriented AI tools (like Perplexity) to find papers and see how similar work analyzed things. It can be good for finding new stuff.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    But some cutting-edge work still won't show up. If you roughly know who the key people are in the area, you still have to click into their personal pages and check their newest papers, to avoid missing things.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">4) Coding vs understanding: my rule for writing code</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    AI can write code. But if you don't understand what it wrote, that's the biggest problem. You can't judge if it's correct. You can't debug it. You can't trust the result.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So when I code, I try not to rely on AI as my default. I use it mainly when:
                </p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>I hit an error and I truly don't know what's wrong</li>
                    <li>I need a quick scaffold and I will inspect everything</li>
                    <li>I need help interpreting an error message</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In short: AI can assist, but analysis still has to be <em>my</em> analysis.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">5) When results come out: interpretation and storytelling is still on me</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    When results come out, interpretation is a complex process.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    First I need to know <strong>where the key point is</strong>.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Then where the contradiction is.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Then only after that can I write the story—find the most reasonable storytelling point.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Storytelling is still mostly on me: reading literature, thinking, connecting.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    But sometimes I use AI in a very specific way: I ask it to help find news, or scan current events, to see whether my work connects to something happening in the world. If it connects, writing from a news angle can bring more attention.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I treat AI like a <strong>full-text search machine</strong> here.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    But judgment is still mine. Always.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">6) Writing as a non-native speaker: AI helps a lot, but big words are a trap</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I'm not a native speaker, and academic writing is very template-like and structured. Once you know what good writing looks like, you can write a draft, then let AI revise/add.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Then you will see the gaps. Then you can push it with follow-up questions.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    But you still need to have the knowledge yourself—otherwise you can't tell if the revision is correct or just "sounds nice."
                </p>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mt-8 mb-4">One extra thing I actively use AI for: "six-year-old clarity"</h3>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    AI often uses big words and makes things complicated. That's one of the biggest writing problems with AI: it inflates language.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So I often do an interactive loop like:
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6 italic text-center py-4">
                    "Explain this so a six-year-old can understand."
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Not because my paper is for six-year-olds, but because <strong>if I cannot make it simple, I probably don't understand it deeply enough.</strong> Making things simple takes discipline and interaction. I keep pushing it: fewer abstractions, more concrete language, clearer logic.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    This is actually one of the best uses of AI in writing—forcing clarity.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">7) Taste matters: AI gives you the "average," scientists are not average</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I think the biggest problem of AI is that it doesn't really "think." So good taste is extremely important.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Taste matters because AI mostly integrates everyone's ideas. And right now, I don't think it has enough high-quality data + selection ability to reliably generate truly new, deep synthesis. Otherwise it produces something like the human average.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    And scientists are not average humans.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In my view, AI learns like a normal distribution: pulled toward the middle value. It can be very smooth, very coherent, very "reasonable"—but not necessarily mind-blowing.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So I tell myself:
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Cherish your own thinking.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Let AI do at most wording edits.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    If it gives a point that genuinely surprises you, record it—but keep your own core viewpoint book. Don't learn everything from AI.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Personally, I learn a lot more from specific people: podcasts, essays, and scholars I trust—because that's where sharp taste and real intellectual style live.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Also, AI often "reduces the dimension." It compresses details. It collects, rewrites, translates—there are many places where errors can happen. That's why we need to be cautious.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">8) Add-on: Gemini "Nano Banana" for scientific figures (flowcharts)</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    One more very practical trick: I also use <strong>Gemini + Nano Banana</strong> for research <strong>figures</strong>, especially <strong>flowcharts</strong> and pipeline diagrams.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    It's not for data plots—if it's data, you should plot with real data and real code. But for process diagrams, the layout is honestly better than humans most of the time.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    The only annoying part is sometimes you need to adjust the font size. But overall the aesthetics are very good. You can edit the text, and the text accuracy is surprisingly high.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I recommend basically every researcher try it at least once—especially if you hate spending three hours nudging boxes in PowerPoint like you're doing digital pottery.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-accent mt-12 mb-6 pb-2 border-b border-accent/30">9) The conclusion: a Chinese lens—Dao (道) and Shu (术)</h2>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In Chinese, we often talk about two layers: <strong>Dao (道)</strong> and <strong>Shu (术)</strong>.
                </p>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6 space-y-4">
                    <li><strong>Shu (术)</strong> is technique: methods, execution, procedures, tools.<br><span class="text-dark-text/70">On the Shu side, AI can do things extremely well.</span></li>
                    <li><strong>Dao (道)</strong> is the deeper way: your observation, your dialogue with yourself, your worldview, how you connect points into meaning, how you decide what matters.<br><span class="text-dark-text/70">On the Dao side, AI cannot do it—at least in my experience. I've tried to make it connect many points into a deep framework, and I haven't been able to truly get that.</span></li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    If someone finds a prompt that can do that reliably, I suspect they are feeding it very high-quality data and very strong guidance, so it learns what "better" looks like. Because often "better" in academia is not the average—it's the outlier insight.
                </p>

                <p class="text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So my final take is:
                </p>

                <div class="quote-highlight p-6 rounded-r-lg mb-8">
                    <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent mb-2"><strong>AI enhances humans mainly on Shu.</strong></p>
                    <p class="text-xl font-semibold text-accent"><strong>Dao is still on you.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Use AI to speed up the procedural parts, so you can protect the deep parts. Double check everything. Keep your taste sharp. And don't outsource your judgment—because that's literally your job as a scientist.
                </p>
