                    Okay. Imagine this: my undergrad life <strong>restarts</strong>. Like… I respawn as a freshman again. Same brain, same hunger, but <strong>zero research opportunities</strong>, zero "connections," zero insider information. Just me, a campus, and that feeling of "I want to do real research, but how do people even get in?"

                    This vlog is basically my cheat-code. Not the fake kind. The real kind. The kind that costs time, effort, and a slightly unhinged level of seriousness.

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mb-8">Chapter 1: If Two Things Can Be Done Together, Do Them Together</h2>
                
                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    When you're young—like <em>really</em> young in your career—time is your biggest advantage. But only if you use it like a strategist.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So here's my first rule:
                </p>

                <div class="chapter-card p-6 rounded-lg mb-8">
                    <p class="text-xl text-accent font-semibold text-center">
                        "If you find a few things can be done together, you do them together."
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Example: you have a course assignment. Most people treat it as "get it done."
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    If I restart? I treat it as: <strong>this could be a literature review.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    So I would take that course paper and <strong>develop it into a real literature review</strong>, with depth. And I would <em>not</em> be trapped by the course rubric, because the rubric treats you like a student.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    But if you want to become a scholar, then:
                </p>

                <p class="text-xl text-accent font-semibold mb-8 text-center">
                    "Please become a scholar now."
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Do the assignment like it's going to be published. Not because it <em>will</em> be published, but because you're training your standards.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Meaning: in every assignment, every project, every task—know exactly what you're doing. Don't outsource your thinking.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Not to your teammate.<br>
                    Not to your future RA.<br>
                    Not to AI.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-gray-400">
                    (And yes I use AI a lot—if you want that workflow, go check my other post. But I'm serious: AI can help, but it can't replace your internal pathway.)
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    Because the thing people don't tell you is: <strong>Aha moments need time.</strong> Humans are amazing because we pause, we breathe, we get stuck, then our brain slowly gets shaped.
                </p>

                    This part is the biggest hack that doesn't feel like a hack.

                    Sometimes "doing research" and "doing undergrad coursework" can literally be the same thing.

                    Let me give you a real example from my life:
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In undergrad I took a class called <strong>psychological assessment</strong>. The assignment was to develop or translate a scale. Most people did the minimum.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Me? I did it step by step, seriously. Like I was building something real. I thought through each procedure carefully. I tried to make it "publication-ready."
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    And because I did the steps properly, later it actually became a real outcome: I collaborated with the professor, we developed it further, and we submitted it as a poster.
                </p>

                <div class="quote-highlight p-6 rounded-lg my-8">

                    <p class="text-dark-text/80 mt-2">
                        They trust you when your work shows: you're serious, you can execute, you already solved 80% of the problems, and the professor only needs to solve the last 20%.

                    You walk into their world first. You help. You support what they need. You start from the other person's perspective.

                    That's not manipulation. That's honestly just… <strong>altruism.</strong> And I still believe research and helping others can be one thing.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    In my junior year, I was a TA for a professor. I told them:<br>
                    "I want to go do real field work with an NGO. I can volunteer. I can help with anything."

                    At first, nobody is going to give you an experiment. Of course. So I started with what is realistic: <strong>archived data</strong>. I did it well. I delivered. I made myself useful.

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    Another thing I did, especially later:
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I started building my own team.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    At first in undergrad, I was often "a team member." I learned work ethic and workflow from strong teams. Then later—especially in my gap year—I started becoming a project leader.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    And honestly, I built this habit early:
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    When I had group work, I chose people who were good to work with. People who could learn together, give each other feedback, and grow.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I never treated teammates as competitors.
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    If I knew something, I would teach it. I would share tricks, software tips, search strategies—because: <strong>People power is real.</strong>
                </p>

                <p class="text-lg text-dark-text/90 leading-relaxed mb-8">
                    I did this with my senior thesis partner too. They didn't have early research training, so I patiently walked through tools and techniques. And when you do that, something happens socially: People feel you're loyal. They feel you're "real." They want to collaborate deeply.
                </p>
